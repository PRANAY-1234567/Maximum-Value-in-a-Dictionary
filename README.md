🏆 Find the Key with Maximum Value in a Dictionary (Python)

📌 Description

This program finds the student with the highest marks from a dictionary.
The dictionary contains student names as keys and their marks as values.

🧩 Problem Statement

Given a dictionary:

{"Ram": 80, "Shyam": 90, "Geeta": 85}


Find the student who scored the highest marks.

✅ Code
marks = {"Ram": 80, "Shyam": 90, "Geeta": 85}

topper = max(marks, key=marks.get)
print(topper)

🧠 Explanation

marks is a dictionary where:

Key → Student name

Value → Marks

max() finds the key with the maximum value

key=marks.get tells Python to compare dictionary values instead of keys

So, the student with the highest marks is returned.
